    "description": "The Climate Change extension changes every mention of 'coronavirus' that you encounter while browsing to 'climate change'. This plug-in does not exist to mock people who have suffered as a result of COVID-19. We do not aim to undermine the impact of the virus. Rather, we created this plug-in with the intention of highlighting the amazing ability of humans to organize and collectively work together to overcome problems. Imagine if governments world-wide moved beyond rhetoric and took meaningful action.",
